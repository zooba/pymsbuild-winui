# pymsbuild-winui

This is a highly experimental and early stage extension to
[pymsbuild](https://pypi.org/project/pymsbuild). It uses the Microsoft
Windows App SDK to build GUI apps based on XAML.

The sample project in [testdata/app1](https://github.com/zooba/pymsbuild-winui/tree/master/tests/testdata/app1)
is currently the best starting point.

Good luck!

(Expressions of interest are welcome right now, but not contributions.)
